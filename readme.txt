Welcome to our "Language Helper" Program

Language Helper is a spell checker program that checks for misspellings in a text.
Spell-checking features are often embedded in software or services, such as a word processor, email client, electronic dictionary, or search engine.
Our program will do the following:
1. Check if the word is an English valid word
2. Provide a list of suggestions for one-edit-distance words.
Our program will utilize methods of insertion, deletion, swapping, changing the case of letters to provide suitable suggestions.
